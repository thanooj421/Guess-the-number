4. *Checking Guess:*
 - If no guess is entered, it prompts the user to input a number.
 - If the guess matches the secret number, the player wins.
 - If the guess is wrong, the game provides hints ('Too high' or 'Too low') and decrements the score.
 - If the score reaches 0, the player loses.

5. *Updating Highscore:* 
 - If the current score surpasses the highscore, the highscore is updated.

6. *Restarting the Game:*
